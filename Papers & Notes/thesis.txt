For each depth of each patient compute:
1) ISI distribution
2) mean/median of the distribution
3) CV of the di
4) shape factor from gamma fit of the di

For each patient, and for each of the 2-4 features
Plot across depths
Depending on the plot
monotonic-> correlation pearson
non monotonic-> identify minima maxima

Population level analysis
align all the patients
for each feature 2-4 ad each depth you consider different patients as different outcomes of the same process

you get a NOVEL "average distribution across depths" of each feature

with this novel distribution you can do statistical test
significance of inter-depth differences

you take the feature describing the distribution of each patient separately and you check if they are similar
ex:

are all the minima of the distribution of CV across depths at the same depth?
